Created by Team TSHLIB as apart of the Dandilyonn SEEDS 2021 Program.

### App Overview
We seek to help Gen-Z build sustainable carbon consumption habits by creating a personalized, youth-centered platform to learn, track, manage, and subsequently reduce individual carbon footprints.
Our app is divided into four core sections to address every step of the habit formation journey. First, users take a quiz to audit their current lifestyle. Then they can learn how to reduce their footprint through our Learn page, which contains a variety of helpful articles and current news. Then they are encouraged to retake the quiz every week to see how their carbon footprint has changed and rewarded for continuous use and large improvements by upgrading levels and receiving a new avatar.

### Why we picked our project
Upon conducting initial user surveys, researching academic articles, and meditating on our own personal experience as members of our target demographic (youth ages 14-24), it was clear that youth today are simultaneously anxious about the threat of climate change and feel demoralized by the fact that they feel they canâ€™t do anything to stop it. We sought to create a product centered around empowering our users to feel like they can make a meaningful contribution toward combating climate change.

Additionally, we wanted to focus on a problem that is tangible, pressing, and able to be tackled on an individual scale, and thus focused on reducing fossil fuel emissions.
