Created by Team TSHLIB as apart of the Dandilyonn SEEDS 2021 Program.

### App Overview
We seek to help Gen-Z build sustainable carbon consumption habits by creating a personalized, youth-centered platform to learn, track, manage, and subsequently reduce individual carbon footprints. Through our app, users can take a quiz to analyze and reflect on their habits related to waste, food, transportation, and energy. The app also offers a variety of articles that users can read and save to learn about best practices to help reduce their carbon footprint as well as be updated on current events happening.
